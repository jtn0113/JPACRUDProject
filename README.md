# US National Parks Explorer

### Description
This is a JPA CRUD project that allows the user to explore the National Parks of the US. The user can browse the parks, select a park to get more information, update a park if the information is wrong, add a park if one is missing, or delete a non-existing park.

From the home page of the site, you will see a list of all of the national parks.
